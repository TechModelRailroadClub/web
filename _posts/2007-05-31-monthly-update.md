 **May 12**John McNamara and David Backus purchased a heroic amount of soda for the machine, which is now filled again. Adam worked on pouring water into the river area he's been working on for quite some time now, and started planning a farm scene for the end of the Berkmannville/staging yard helix. Tom added a [layout diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/old/progress/reports/2007/5/../../../../TNP/index.html) to the TNP web page (the diagram was originally made by JP), along with a new page describing how our [camera cars]({{ site.baseurl }}/old/progress/reports/2007/5/../../../../video/CameraCars.html) work. **May 16**Andy worked on some scenery in Middle Heights. John Shriver continued to hang the overhead trolley wires. Quentin acquired a new laptop off reuse for the staging area and installed it. **May 19**  It's the end of term and we had a quiet evening, with a pizza instead of General Gao's chicken. Ably supervised by John McNamara, John Purbrick continued work on the "uphill" side of the track at Middle Heights, beginning by doing a traumatic disconnection of a switch machine, which necessitated a spliced cable. As often happens on model railroads, we seem to be heading for some "geographically unlikely" construction. Tom arrived in time to make the pictures look better.
