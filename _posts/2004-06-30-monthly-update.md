 **June 30** The Gifford City station scene and the 105th Street industrial area are now completely separate   scenes, thanks to the view block buildings constructed by David Lambeth. Since the buildings are   difficult to access in their normal location, David does most of his work with the buildings out of   place. On the Gifford City station side of the view block, there are office buildings, a hotel, and   a condominium. The 105th street side is a replica of the Metropolitan Storage Warehouse.
