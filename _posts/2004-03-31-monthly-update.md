 **March 31** Throughout this year, work has been proceeding apace on the freight yard. The design includes a   team track, or in modern terms "transloading facility," which has been a favorite project for Adam   Madlinger. Since this photo was taken, Adam has completed the trackage in this area, and work has   begun on yard tracks that will connect with the roundhouse shown in the left background. A complete   Diesel servicing facility is planned for those yard tracks.
