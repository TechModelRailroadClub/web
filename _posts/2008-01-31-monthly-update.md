 **January 5**  
  
 Progress for tonight was WEEDS. A lovely new patch of WEEDS has appeared between the main line and the bulk transfer siding across from F\-Yard.   Also, last weekend (which was actually in December '07\) the aforementioned siding was subjected to tectonic forces which lowered it relative to the main line and changed its slope from downward to level. This has the effect of ending the unpleasant habit of cars rolling from the siding down onto the main line. It also gives a more pleasing appearance, with the difference in levels making a visual separation between the main line and the siding. And it creates an attractive location for WEEDS.   Genya did some programming which was "somewhat technical" but "related to Java 1\.5". It had nothing to do with WEEDS.  Bill stained ties on the extended industrial siding at the back of F\-Yard. Again it featured no WEEDS.
