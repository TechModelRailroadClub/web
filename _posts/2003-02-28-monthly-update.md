 **February 9**In recent weeks, John Purbrick created a computer\-plotted version of  Malcolm Laughlin's pencil\-drawn design for the new layout addition.  Yesterday evening, James Knight and Alvar Saenz\-Otero used the computer  plot to select locations for support panels and built a third support  panel, as shown in the attached photo. (Alvar, Tom O'Reilly, and Howard  Gorin built \#1; James and Thaddeus Stefanov\-Wagner built \#2\).  In other work not photographically documented, Malcolm installed several  jack panels for walk\-around control cabs;John McNamara worked on the  Digital Widgets building restoration; Andy Miller and Bill Onorato worked  on Berkmannville; John Purbrick worked on his automated car identification  system; Ed Drozd (Wednesday) worked on a new warehouse building; and Tom  worked on the System3 GUI.  *John McNamara* \[\[missing pix]]
