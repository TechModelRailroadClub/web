 **October 4**   
  
 We agreed to open the club to a group of alumni attending a party at the Museum. The party was held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Smoot marks on the Harvard Bridge, and Mr Oliver Reed Smoot himself honored the club with his presence. David added some Smoot marks of our own.
