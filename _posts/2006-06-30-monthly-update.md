 **June 10**The club hosted numerous visitors today. Some were here for alumni weekend (classes of '61, '66, '76 were spotted in the room), some were in Boston for the weekend, and some were local people who just found us for the first time. We even had an MIT student stop by with a friend after seeing us in the MIT events calendar. All of this meant that little train\-related work got done, but that's okay. The good news is that the system and trains worked fine all evening (once the track and wheels were cleaned that is.) Even the trolley system ran without too much trouble after the speed was reduced to stop some intermittent derailments.**June 24**John McNamara worked on scenery in the Green River area, specifically the section that fits under the east end of the bridge. He is working on a way to fill the gaps between the ground and the bridge supports. Tom took pictures for a new layout tour that has been posted to the web page [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/old/progress/reports/2006/6/../../../../TNP/index.html). We also discovered a burned out bulb on the tetris game, which will be a pain in the neck to replace.
