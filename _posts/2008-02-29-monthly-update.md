 **February 16**The theme for this week is PROGRESS.    
  
 There was much Progress in East Berkmannville, pressed ahead by Adam, Quentin and David L. "Gentlemen, shall Progress occur here?" 
  
 Adam says there are lots of pictures in existence showing him bending down to work on something. So we rearranged gravity to let him stay upright. 
 Progress promotes paraphernalia's proliferation.
