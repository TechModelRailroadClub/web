 **September 9**We planned an operating session, tested cab interface boards, tried unsuccessfully to find a partially completed building, had two separate groups of visitors, Quentin fixed the Green building Tetris in a way even he doesn't understand, David L. used some power tools without incident, Adam marveled at the light control system, David B. made unrealistic plans for a very cool track cleaning car, and Quentin looked up obscene computer names on campus. By TMRC standards, this was a hell of a night!**September 24** Various small jobs were undertaken tonight, but applying black paint to the back of the mountain (with the objective of making the tunnels darker) was obviously lots of fun! Nevertheless it was an exacting job, requiring serious supervision. Old\-timers will be happy to see the Pink Elephant still on the job. And *Tech Talk* being used appropriately. **September 29** A committee of experts tested the freight car fleet in advance of future Operating Sessions. This involved checking weight, couplers, wheels, rolling friction and electrical resistance. Note the test track and weighing scale.
