 **January 2**TMRC now owns a steam locomotive, our first in who knows how long (except BITCo \#1/2, which seems to have wandered away).    
  
 It's the Bachmann Spectrum model of the Baldwin 2\-8\-0 ("Consolidation") which was made in more or less the same form for many railroads, and used from the beginning of the 20th century until the last steam locos retired. Our engine is undecorated, ready to have TNP markings applied, and maybe some weathering done..
