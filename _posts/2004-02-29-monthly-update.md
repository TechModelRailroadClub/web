 **February 29** In this photo, David Lambeth and Genya Zaytman are adding scenic touches to "city hall hill." David  is adding a coat of the thinned shellac that Genya is holding. This will create an appropriately  darkened pavement. Since the time this photo was taken, the steep white slope in the foreground has  been covered with a realistic tumble of large rocks, and the white building mockup in the lower  right corner has been replaced with a real building.
