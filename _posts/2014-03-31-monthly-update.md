 **March 01**   
  
 John P got the new shelves started\-\-after several trips to the big\-box hardware stores in search of suitable anchors and fasteners. Already the clutter on the desktop has been reduced (until more clutter arrives and the old stuff remains around, so we'll have a cluttered desk *and* shelves). The shelves are temporary and were made from a nice big piece of particleboard out of the trash room.
