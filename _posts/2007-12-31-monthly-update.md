 **December 15** [\[pictures]]({{ site.baseurl }}/old/progress/reports/2007/12/../../../imagese221.tcl?year=2007&month=12&day=15) Although we haven't posted progress reports for a few weeks, there has been progress.   David L has constructed several buildings in Berkmannville, and John P's warehouse has been added too. Berkmannville is shaping up as the New England mill town it's intended to be, crammed into a valley with a river and (of course) a railroad.         Quentin worked on a building and scenery in Middle Heights. He filled in the missing scenery closest to the road, and he added LED lighting to the small building.    Genya worked on software involving train direction.     We got a Bachmann 44\-tonner. It is So Cute.
