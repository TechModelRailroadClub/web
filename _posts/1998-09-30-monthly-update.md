 **September 22**Jeff installed a replacement version of the doorbell that historically rang when FOO was pushed. Four new "feather\-touch" push buttons have been installed around the layout to reinstate the traditional TMRC FOO BAR. John McNamara worked on the roundhouse and installed the first piece of replacement flooring. The question at hand is how to get it it to match the color of the existing flooring. John Purbrick worked on a tester that will be used with the switch control system.
