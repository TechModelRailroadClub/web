 **February 13**     
 Some belated credit for David Lambeth of the West Coast Shops. He made these gorgeous silos for the chemical plant. 
  
 He also made a section of viaduct to connect with Andy Miller's bridge in Killianport. This is based on the Lechmere viaduct just down the road. 
 
  
 Lots of Progress by Alex! Here's some construction in East Berkmannville. 
 
  
 This is a small building\-\-for East Berkmannville? 
 
  
 Here it is complete. 
 
  
 A small display unit to be used on the platform at Killianport as a train indicator. 
 
  
 Prajwal, visiting from wherever he is these days, was impressed. 
 
  
 Now it has our text on it. 
 
  
 John P did some more cutting of plywood for Level 2\. Working out in the hallway means cleaning up is easier. 
 
  
 Level 2 above East Berkmannville, with junk already in place. The front\-to\-back depth is 20 inches, which was acceptable by consensus of TMRC members in the room. 
 
  
 New steelwork to support the plywood, involving hard\-to\-find "cone nuts". 
 
  
 Another of Alex's projects\-\-a walkway outside the roundhouse. 
 
  
 And another of John P's\-\-more LED lighting as Level 2 progresses. 
 
  
 We were favored with a visit from members of the Rochester Institute of Technology's Model Railroad Club, and we traded a couple of freight cars with them. Note that one car is finished and weathered, and the other is "some assembly required". Their railroad is the Rochester \& Irondequoit Terminal.
