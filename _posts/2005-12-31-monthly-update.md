 **December 9**TMRC was honored to be host to a delegation from the Rochester Institute of Technology Model Railroad Club, who were visiting Boston to photograph stretcars. We set up a joint operating session with cars placed and orders written by Malcolm Laughlin, and several of our own members plus five visitors ran trains. Some System glitches were observed, and there was some uncertainty over which features are now operational, but in general a fine time was had by all.  **December 21**How many TMRC members does it take to change a light bulb? Just one, if it's James, but he had two supervisors. Tonight, James balanced precariously from a ladder and hung from the sprinkler pipes to replace burnt out bulbs in the front of the room. These lights are always on to light the area that is visible from the hallway. James also redirected some of the track lights to illuminate some of the more recent scenic additions in that part of the club, such as the city hall.
