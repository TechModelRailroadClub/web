 **June 15**   
  
 One of the switch machines at the chemical factory is operated by a hobby servo.  There's a video of it available at  [this address.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8G7HyrACEw)   The turnout is operated simultaneously with another that's moved by a Tortoise machine, as is quite obvious on the soundtrack!
