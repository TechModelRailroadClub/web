 **March 6**  David L made a mockup of the proposed helix between the 2nd and 3rd levels. It dominates the scene at Middle Heights.    James and Hugh dropped in. We hadn't seen them for quite a while. At this moment they seemed to be looking heavenward for inspiration.    David has also been putting together conductive wheelsets. He has quite a production line going.      **March 17**
