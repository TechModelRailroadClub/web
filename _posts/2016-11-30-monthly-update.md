 **November 9**   
  
 We received a message from the daughter of former member Eric Bott, who made the Coca\-Bubblie sign back in his student days around 1970\. It's in a prominent location and continues to be admired. The visit she suggested wasn't possible, but we hope she'll call this picture to her dad's attention.
