 **October 15** A new verison of the [System 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/old/progress/reports/2005/10/../../../../sys3/index.html) user interface, SCab, has been installed on the computers in the club room. SCab 2 has been enhanced with improved layout diagrams, better editing features and has been rewritten to make it possible to show different diagrams on different computers (yard computers for instance). **October 26** On October 26th, TMRC was honored to receive a visit from Hiroshi Kato, president of [Kato Precision Railroad Models](http://www.katousa.com/), manufacturers of some of the best model railroad equipment available. His visit to TMRC was the sole object of a round trip from Chicago, and was arranged by the Club's friend Hidetoshi Katsuma, who also visited this week. In keeping with Japanese tradition, Mr. Kato brought a gift \- three bi\-level commuter coaches and an F40 locomotive. According to TMRC's "[Psiton]({{ site.baseurl }}/old/progress/reports/2005/10/../../../../dictionary.html#psiton) Theory," an important visitor viewing the layout will cause derailments, but these did not occur. Perhaps Psiton Theory does not apply if the equipment being run was manufactured by the visitor. System3 worked well, but psitons did affect one of the yard computers, which failed during Mr. Kato's visit.
