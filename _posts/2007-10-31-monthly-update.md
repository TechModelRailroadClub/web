 **October 07**Adam spent much of the evening building better black holes. The picture shows (from left) Adam admiring his handiwork, Hugh queietly surveying tthe scene, David B. admiring Adam's black hole, Genya, doing who knows what, and David L. looking in an insufficiently black hole that Adam has yet to address. David B. contemplated what to do with the long neglected lumber yard area. David L. worked on a variety of things. Bill worked on sidings behind F\-yard. Tom prepared to list some recently donated items on eBay. There is an incomplete plan to have an operating session on October 20\. This may or may not actually happen.
