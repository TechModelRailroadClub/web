 **May 26** [\[pictures]]({{ site.baseurl }}/old/progress/reports/2002/5/../../../images1a5a.tcl?year=2002&month=5&day=26) For all the System 2 nostalgia buffs out there, Tom has posted some pictures of System 2\. These are some of the last pictures of System 2 taken in the club room before it leaves for the New England Museum of Telephony in Ellsworth, Maine. Most of the cruft behind and under the system has been removed in preparation for the removal of the system.
