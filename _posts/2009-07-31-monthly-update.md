 **July 15** Michael's latest in freight car assembly. This time it's an Intermountain cylindrical covered hopper kit.   The "Chesapeake" is the Chesapeake \& Lake Erie, the railroad of the North Shore Model Railroad Club, where we have many friends.     
  
 The brake components are very small and precise.
