 **November 4** This evening's major project was discussion of a tower. For those not familiar with the layout as it stands, the following piece of ASCII\-art may be useful:  ```                        ________________________                      /         P-yard          \                     /                           \                     
        _________          
       West          
       /          \   GC   
    East                     
      /            
  loop 
                      \     
            
       
                       \     \            \      /                        XX
