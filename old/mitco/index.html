Trolleys at TMRC
</H1>
<P>
Trolley enthusiasts have built streetcar systems at TMRC since 1954.
The current layout continues this tradition, although with the
simplest track plan it has ever had.  Trolleys are powered by
electricity provided by an overhead wire in the real world, and TMRC's
trolley systems have always been built to operate in the same way.
</P>
<P>
We feel that running streetcars at TMRC is particularly appropriate in
a city that still runs streetcars (well, Light Rail Vehicles) on the
MBTA's Green Line, and will continue to run real streetcars on the Red
Line's Ashmont-Mattapan "High Speed" Line.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<H2>
MITCo Today at TMRC
</H2>
<P>
MITCo is name of the trolley system at TMRC.  MITCo is the
abbreviation for Messachusetts Interurban Traction Company.  (TMRC has
a tradition of silly or punny names for things.)  MITCo service has
always served the Gifford City TNP passenger station, providing local
service for passengers.  The streetcars run in the middle of the
street. You can see all of MITCo at our <A HREF="../video/index.html">videos</A> page.
</P>
<H3>
MITCo Track Plan
</H3>
<P>
The current MITCo track plan is the simplest one MITCo has ever had.
It is designed to look like a double track mainline, with each end
going off the edge of the layout.  In fact, each end has a turning
loop short of where it goes off the end of the layout, such that the
operational track is what is known as a dogbone track.  A dogbone has
most of the track parallel along the length, with a loop formed at
each end.
</P>
<P>
All the spurs off of this loop are only scenic, as they all go off the
edge of the layout.  They are not fully operational.
</P>
<P>
One loop is the downtown loop, which goes around a block of tall
buildings.  This loop is the only part of MITCo that was saved from
the old Building 20 layout in 1997.  The tall block of buildings are
all the same height, in order to hide the fact that the block is
hollow, and there is an access hole in the middle.  This access hole
is quite necessary in order to be able to reach the track and wire for
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The loop connects to double track through the main street of Gifford
City, facing the window wall into the hall.  It passes along the very
tall wall of buildings, and past the Gifford City passenger station.
From there, it goes around a broad curve overlooking the depressed
tracks of the passenger station, past the Post Office.
</P>
<P>
On the inside of this curve is the four-track carbarn, which
provides storage and service facilities for the streetcards.  The
carbarn was built by Alex Bardow in the late 1970's, and was moved
from the Building 20 layout.  The trackwork connecting it to the
street tracks is more than a bit of a "show off" project.  The angle
of the switch ladder was chosen to cause overlaps of the frogs and
mates of the switches.  This trackwork is so arranged that cars can
pull in off one track, and pull out into the other track.
</P>
<P>
The streetcar mainline then crosses a very temporary bridge over the
Whattahack River.  This may be replaced by a vertical lift bridge, or
perhaps by a fixed span bridge.
</P>
<P>
From here, the nominal streetcar mainline passes Pettingill Circle,
and proceeds off the edge of the layout.  In reality, the track only
takes the loop around Pettingill Circle, a narrow loop of street
through an old-time business and residential district.
</P>
<H3>
MITCo Design Ideas
</H3>
<P>
The biggest change from the prior MITCo systems is that the main line
is double-track from one end to the other.  This was done since it
really allows for a better looking urban street.  It doesn't really
make the street any wider, since you can model it with four lanes, two
travel (shared with streetcars), and two parking.  With a track down
the middle of the stret, you need a travel lane on either side of the
track, plus a parking lane on each side, so you really need five lanes
curb to curb.  The only downside of the double-track scheme is that
you can't leave any automobiles on the travel lanes, since they would
be in the way.  However, the large amount of non-operational track in
this layout allows leaving automobiles on the track in those areas.
</P>
<H3>
MITCo Construction Details
</H3>
<H4>
Trackwork
</H4>
<P>
All of MITCo's trackwork is in the street, using track that simulates
prototype girder rail.  Streetcar tracks in paving are normally laid
using girder rail.  This is a rail that has the head offset somewhat
to the side, with a lip that comes up under one side to form a groove
for the wheel flange, and a lip (like a guard rail) to form the far
side of the groove.  This lip is very important, as it prevents the
paving (especially cobblestones and paving bricks) from creeping into
the path of the wheel flange.  Older wheels had rather brittle
flanges, and they could be chipped by paving stones, which in turn
caused a safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
The current MITCo track is built using manufactured girder rail.
TMRC's supply was bought from Richard Orr, who designed the rail, and
funded having it rolled by RailCraft (now Micro-Engineering).  This
rail is still available, from Custom Traxx.
</P>
<P>
The Orr girder rail provides a flangeway that is fully conformant with
the NMRA standards.  The head of the rail is the same size as current
code 100 rail, and the rail is the same height (100/1000 of an inch)
as code 100 rail.
</P>
<P>
The trick with the Orr girder rail is that the cross-section is
extremely asymmetric.  If you try and curve it sideways by hand, it
will also curve vertically.  It also loves to kink when bent.  Orr
makes a special jig with rollers shaped to match the side profile of
the rail, which allow smoothly curving the rail with almost no
vertical curve.
</P>
<P>
The current track is laid on top of 1/4" by 1-1/4" pine lattice
stock.  This is nailed and glued to the 3/4" plywood roadbed.  No ties
are used, the rail is spiked directly to the lattice stock.
</P>
<P>
Note that the spacing of the two tracks is quite close.  They are
closer than the NMRA standards, at 11-1/2 scale feet center-to-center.
Note that the spacing increases dramatically around curves, so that
streetcars will not hit each other there.  The spacing was tested with
a model of a Washington, Baltimore, and Annapolis articulated
interuban car, which is quite large.  Hopefully they will also clear a
Pacific Electric "Blimp", but we havent tested this.  (Not that we'd
move the track now, but we may yet have to move a trolley pole or
two.)
</P>
<P>
All of the switches are "single point" which is traditional for
trolley street trackwork.  In a single point switch, there is only a
moving point in one rail.  On the other side, there is a "mate", which
just has grooves in both directions.  The single point guides the car
in the correct direction by pushing against the wheel flange.
Normally, the point is on the inside of the curve, and the mate on the
outside.
</P>
<P>
The switches are built from a combination of Orr girder rail, and from
our earlier technology of using a code 100 running rail with a code 70
soldered sideways into it to make the flangeway.  This happens to work
very well for making the closure rails, point, and mate portions of
the switch.
</P>
<H4>
Paving
</H4>
<P>
The current paving around the track is all patching plaster, colored
with powdered carbon black.  Curbs are formed by more lattice stock,
which gives the street a 1/10" crown.  Wiring staples (from a T-25
staple gun) into the plywood provide an anchor to secure the plaster
to the layout.  The plaster is mixed to a moderate consistency, and
laid from curb to curb, up to the rail heads.  The plaster is worked
as little as possible while wet, since we don't want the work
hardening of a classic wall plaster job.  When the plaster is set just
hard enough, paint scrapers are used to do a final smoothing, and to
ensure that the plaster is all a few thousandths of an inch below the
top surfaces of the rail.
</P>
<P>
When the plaster work is done with final shaping, there is a very
important final step.  The plaster is sealed with shellac diluted with
alcohol.  This is abosolutely essential, since otherwise the plaster
continues to release a fine dust, which is very abrasive and gets into
the gears of the streetcars.  So long as the shellac is properly
diluted, it doesn't make the streets shiny, it just soaks into the
plaster, makes it hard, and makes it a good bit darker.  Sometimes it
makes the color a bit more uneven, but real streets are uneven as
well.
</P>
<H4>
Sidewalks
</H4>
<P>
The sidewalks are all made from sheet styrene, about 0.060 inches
thick.  It is all cut to shape, and then scribed for expansion joints.
Andy Miller is our expert sidewalk painter, airbrushing them a light
grey, and they overspraying with a spatter of brown and darker grey.
They are glued down over the lattice stock that forms the sides of the
road, overlapping slightly onto the paving, making smooth curves.
</P>
<H4>
Trolley Wire
</H4>
<P>
The overhead wire is in the last stages of completion.  The main loop
has been closed, but there are some adjustments needed at the backside
of the loop, as one frog causes consistent dewirements.
</P>
<P>
The wire is hung 3 inches above the track, which is 1/4" higher than
the NMRA standard.  This was more important in the old trolley system,
which operated interchange freight, but has been continued in the
current system.  It does make it easier to reach a hand and arm under
the wire for cleaning operations.
</P>
<P>
The trolley poles are mostly 1/8" diameter brass rod, which can be
bought cheaply as brazing rod.  Some older poles are steel, and there
is a group made of bronze.  (The bronze is close to impossible to
solder to, not a good choice.)
</P>
<P>
The overhead wire is a very fine 0.01" diameter copper-plated steel,
which is number 30 AWG.  This wire is 33% smaller than the number 26
trolley wire commonly used in HO scale, so it looks much nicer.  It is
also extremely strong, and does not stretch with age.
</P>
<P>
The wire is held in place by trolley ears, which are soldered to the
wire, and then connected to pullof and span wires which connect to the
trolley poles.  Most of these ears are old Suydam ears, the newer ones
are from Precision Scale Company.  The spacing between the pulloff
ears on curves is based on prototype information from the 1920's,
which is much closer together than many trolley modelers use.
</P>
<P>
One disadvantage of this steel wire is it's high electrical
resistance.  This requires that many connections be made from it to
the a sturdy electrical bus under the layout, otherwise there will be
slow spots on the layout.  Over 50 trolley poles are soldered to a
network of 12 gauge Teflon-insulated white/black candy-cane wire.
</P>
<H4>
Electrical
</H4>
<P>
The track for MITCo is divided into conventinal track blocks, although
there are currently no block switches.  All the blocks are currently
bussed together, and wired temporarily to a simple power pack.  Since
the overhead wire is not yet complete, the trolleys are currently
running in two-rail mode.  This is the way MITCo systems have always
been built, the two-rail operation allows thorough testing of the
track before hanging the wire, as it is exceedingly difficult to make
any adjustments to the track with the wire and paving in the way.
</P>
<P>
Once the overhead wire is complete, then operation will switch to
drawing power from the overhead wire, just like the prototype.  The
power comes from the overhead wire, goes down the trolley pole into
the streetcar, through the motors, and on to the wheels and rails back
to the power pack.  Just like the prototype, the trolley pole makes
ocassional blue sparks against the trolley wire.
</P>
<P>
Considerations are being given to installing DCC on MITCo, it's quite
popular with trolley modelers, because the trolleys need to be able to
get quite close to each other.  We cannot use the standard
computerized progressive cab control system the mainline uses, because
it's not compatible with overhead wire operation, especially with the
wire as a "common rail" system.
</P>
<H3>
MITCo Bad Examples
</H3>
<P>
There are some aspects of the current MITCo which we would not
recommend other modelers try and copy.  The biggest one is that some
of the track is simply too far from the edge of the layout.  Hanging
wire over the track between the passenger station tracks and the tall
wall of buildings requires squatting on the passenger yard.  (There is
the alternative of removing the great wall of buildings, but that is
major project.)
</P>
<P>
Some of the wiggles in the track around Gifford City station came out
a bit silly.  They would have made more sense had there been platforms
in the street, but the station wound up closer to the street than was
expected.
</P>
<P>
We would suggest that anyone considering trying to use the same type
of wire for the trolley wire note that if a hanger is pulled off the
wire, it removes the copper plating as well.  Also, using too much
heat and active flux can remove the copper plating.  We have not yet
found any way to solder directly to the steel wire, whatever alloy it
is will not tin.  Generally, if a spot on the wire is so damaged,
either we have to relocate the hanger, or we have to replace a section
of the wire.  This problem is a strong motivation for using
closely-spaced trolley ears, so that the side tension on each one is
minimized.  This greaty reduces the chance of them pulling off.
</P>
<P>
Some of the overhead wires go for extremely long distances without any
switch pans.  This leads to having to manage very long lengths of wire
during installation, since there is no easy way to make a splice.  I
did make some splice hangers by mounting a Pacific Scale trolley
hanger in a vise on a Dremel drill press, and drilling two number 80
holes up through the hanger at an angle away from the center.  These
can be used like a prototype wire splice.  It would be nicer not to
need these, but I wound up using three because of places where I lost
the tinning on the wire.
</P>
<H3>
TMRC Trolley Trackwork Evolution
</H3>
<P>
Various methods have been used to simulate girder rail in building the
MITCo tracks through the years.  Most prototype streetcar track has
used girder rail.
</P>
<P>
H. Clark Frazier used two code 100 rails side by side, soldered
together at the bottom.  This resulted in a flageway (the groove) that
was reasonably consistent with the NMRA trackwork standards.  But the
two wide railheads on each side made for track that looked far heaver
(and shinier) than the real thing.  This technology also depended on
HO scale rail cross-sections that are different from what is available
today, those rails had narrower bases than today's rail.  Using this
technique today would result in a very wide flangeway.  
</P>
<P>
Dana Pettingill's track used two code 70 rails side by side.  There
were some spikes in the gap between the rails.  They were also
soldered together, somewhat, but the gap was rather wide to do this
particularly well.  It was also rather easy to damage the rail when
cleaning out excess solder after the soldering process.  Also,
probably from the temptation of making soldering the rails together
easier, the guard rails were often too close to the running rail,
violating the NMRA guaging standards.  This "check guage" error would
often cause the wheelsets on the trolley cars to drift to being
wide-gauge, and could lead to derailments.  
</P>
<P>
John Shriver's 1980's trackwork used code 100 rail as the running
rail.  The guard rail was formed by putting a peice of code 70 rail
sideways against the code 100 rail, with the head of the code 70 rail
butted into the side of web of the code 100 rail.  They are then
soldered together using a big honking 100 watt soldering iron.  This
technique is reasonably easy on straight track.  It is quite difficult
on curved track, as the code 70 track has to be laboriously curved in
a vertical direction, smoothly.  The cross-section of railroad track
(real and model) is designed to be make this difficult -- this is the
direction that track is supposed to be strong in.  This system results
in very attractive rail, as the lip on the inside of the rail is very
thin.  There are also no check gauge problems.  But there are problems
with the flangeway getting shallower than the NMRA standard, if the
code 70 rail is allowed to sit a little too high when soldering.  Even
when executed correctly, the flangeway is just deep enough for a NMRA
RP-25 flange on the wheels, equipment with deeper US or European
flanges tries to run on the flanges, and this works horribly, since
there's no way to keep the bottom of the flangeway clean.
</P>
<H3>
Trolley Paving Evolution
</H3>
<P>
The paving used by Frazier and Pettingill was Savogran Wood Putty,
which was TMRC's standard scenery material in those days.  TMRC bought
by the 100 pound tub.  Wood Putty unfortunately was a bad choice for
this, as it is designed to expand as it hardens.  This caused it to
mess up the rail gauge as it hardened, generally resulting in slightly
wide-gauge track.  This exacerbated MITCo's check gauge problems.  The
expansion also made it swell up over the top of the rail head, which
left the streetcars wheels often riding on paving instead of track,
which makes for poor electrical connection.
</P>
<P>
Frazier's wood putty was natural color, and painted black.  As
attempts were made to sand it back down even with the rail heads,
white areas were exposed.
</P>
<P>
Pettingill's wood putty was colored by mixing in carbon black,
eliminating the "white" problem.  Unfortunately, wood putty mixed with
carbon black hardens much more quickly, and winds up even harder than
wood putty normally dries.  This made sanding or scraping it out of
the way of the rails very difficult.
</P>
<P>
Current trackwork has all been paved with plaster mixed with
carbon black, sealed with diluted shellac.
</P>
<H3>
Overhead Wire Evolution
</H3>
<P>
The original overhead wire of MITCo was the standard 26 gauge
phosphor-bronze wire, probably bought from Suydam, who also provided
the hangers.  It was hung to operate with trolley poles only.  The
wire is soldered to a small groove in the bottom of the trolley
hangers, which are then connected to span and pulloff wires that
eventually connect to trolley poles.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970's, John Purbrick bought a huge spool of 30 gauge
copper-plated steel wire from Eli Heffron's electronic surplus store
in Cambridge near MIT.  This wire is much smaller than the 26 gauge
phosphor-bronze wire, and is extremely strong, and never stretches
over time.  The downsides of this wire is its high resistance (many
poles must be fed electrically under the layout), and the fact that
the copper plating can be pulled off the steel, resulting in a spot on
the wire that cannot be soldered to for repairing the pulled hanger.
We have since determined that this wire is probably MIG welding wire.
</P>
<P>
When Dana S. Emery started working on the overhead, he converted
sections of it to this new trolley wire.  He also attempted to make
the overhead wire allow universal use by both trolley poles and
pantographs.  Unfortunately, the result was wire that worked horribly
for both.
</P>
<P>
In 1976 John Shriver and Edwin Kreoker started replacing much of the
trolley wire, all with the new wire.  The compromise operation was
removed, and pole-only configuration ruled.
</P>
