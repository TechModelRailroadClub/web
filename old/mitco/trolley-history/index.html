TMRC Trolley History
</H1>
<H2>
MITCo
</H2>
<P>
There has been a MITCo at TMRC since about 1954.  All MITCo systems
have featured hand-laid track, and operational overhead trolley wire.
The streetcars get their electricity from the pole running on the
wire, run it through the motors, and return it through the wheels to
the rails -- just like the real thing.
</P>
<H3>
The First MITCo 1953-1958
</H3>
</P>
<P>
The first MITCo system was built by Charles Robinson and David
Berkowitz.  The track they built was the first hand-laid track at
TMRC, until that time all the trackwork had been Tru-Scale products,
which featured rails pre-spiked to a wooden roadbed with milled ties.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="MITCo-map.gif"><IMG SRC="MITCo-mapSM.gif"
TITLE="Map of First MITCo" ALT="Map of First MITCo"></A>
</P>
<P>
The track plan featured loop to loop operation serving the passenger
yard area.  An interurban line went over the Valley and Plains
division of the TNP, terminating in a wye.
</P>
<P>
This flyover track was still in service in 1979 when the original TMRC
was dismantled for the move to building N52.  At that point, it was
the only visible brass rail on the layout, all other visible track
being laid with Nickel-Silver rail.  It was code 70 rail, an unusually
small size to be using in the 1950's.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="MITCo1.jpg"><IMG SRC="MITCo1SM.jpg" TITLE="Overall View of
First MITCo" ALT="Overall View of First MITCo"></A>
</P>
<P>
This is an overall view of the first MITCo in 1958.  (These first five
photographs are by Charles Robinson.)  You are looking straight down
the main street track.  The elevated passenger yard is on the right,
the freight yard is on the left.  In the background, you can see the
track over the Valley and Plains Division in the background, with the
bridge marked MITCo.  The level of scenery is typical for TMRC in this
era.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="MITCo2.jpg"><IMG SRC="MITCo2SM.jpg" TITLE="First MITCo Loop"
ALT="First MITCo Loop"></A>
</P>
<P>
This is a view of the loop at the end of the line.  The track passes
under the lead of the passenger yard to get here.  The streetcar on
the far left is on the track to the flyover.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="MITCo3.jpg"><IMG SRC="MITCo3SM.jpg" TITLE="First MITCo
Downtown Loop" ALT="First MITCo Downtown Loop"></A>
</P>
<P>
This is a view of the downtown loop area.  The streetcar is coming out
from underneath the passenger yard loop.  To the right of the
streetcar is one of the two diamond crossings betwen the trolley line
and the main line.  These were the source of much mischief on the part
of the trolley operators, and much anger by mainline operators whose
delicate steam locomotives smashed into the cast metal streetcars!
</P>

</P>
<P>
These are views of the passing siding in the middle of the main street
of MITCo.  The passenger yard is on the left in the first photo, and
in the background of the second photo.
</P>
<H3>
Second MITCo Main Street 1958-1982
</H3>
<P>
The downtown street portion of MITCo was rebuilt after it was warped
and damaged by a fire sprinkler failure in February 1958.  The new
track was not straight like the first one.  It had many bends, both
horizontal and vertical.  Most of the street never had land added on
either side, to mention buildings.  The primary building was the
Gifford City passenger station, built by Andy Miller.  Derailments
could be fatal, as they would lead to a 42 inch trip to the floor.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="GiffordCityStation1976.jpg"><IMG
SRC="GiffordCityStation1976SM.jpg" TITLE="Gifford City Station on
Hilly Main Street" ALT="Gifford City Station on Hilly Main
Street"></A>
</P>
<P>
This 1976 view shows the main street passing Gifford City Station.
Note the open pits on the front left, and across the street from the
station.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="GiffordCity1979.jpg"><IMG
SRC="GiffordCity1979SM.jpg" TITLE="Gifford City" ALT="Gifford City"></A>
</P>
<P>
In this 1979 view, you can see that scraps of plywood have been added
to make more land along Main Street.  The same passenger yard that was
there in 1958 is still there, but now with the "Great Wall of Gifford
City" holding it up.
</P>
<H3>
Pettengill Circle 1965-1997
</H3>
<P>
H. Clark Frazier designed and built a new city loop and carbarn ladder
for MITCo, which came to be known as Pettengill Circle.  This
eliminated the diamond crossings of the mainline.  It incorporated a
large yard along the interurban track, which eventually got a freight
interchange with the TNP mainline.  The overhead wire for this loop
was built by Dana Pettengill.
</P>
<P>
In the last picture in the previous section, you can see Pettengill
Circle on the right, behind the Passenger yard loop track.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="PettengillCircle1979.jpg"><IMG
SRC="PettengillCircle1979SM.jpg" TITLE="Pettengill Circle"
ALT="Pettengill Circle"></A>
</P>
<P>
In this 1979 view of Pettengill circle, the power plant is on the far
left, the pentagonal building is Pettengill Circle Pharmacy, behind it
is the carbarn built by Alex Bardow, and the rightmost building is
Page Dairy, named for Dana's future wife Nancy Page.  To the far right
is the wye connecting the loop to the interurban line and the
interchange yard.  The tracks to the power plant are served off the
interchange yard.
</P>
<P>
The carbarn trackwork was always problematic.  Many of the switches
were laid right on top of a major joint of three squares of the
original four-foot benchwork grid this part of the layout was built
on, leading to serious instability of the roadbed underneath the rails.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="PettengillCircle1986.jpg"><IMG
SRC="PettengillCircle1986SM.jpg" TITLE="Pettengill Circle"
ALT="Pettengill Circle"></A>
</P>
<P>
In this 1986 photograph taken for the Railroad Model Craftsman article
on TMRC, you see a more scenic Pettengill circle.  The building behind
the power plant on the left is the Lone Star Cinema building, which
was a hollow building around the access hole on that side of the
street.  The track in front of the carbarn was paved with hand-carved
cobblestones by James VanBokkelen.  Some of the buildings in the
distance are not in their normal places, they have been placed on the
mainline to fill in the background for the photo shoot, along with a
blue backdrop.
</P>
<H3>
Third MITCo Main Street 1982-1997
</H3>
<P>
When the Gifford City passenger yard and station were moved to room
20E-220 in 1982, the old MITCo city street system was rendered
out-of-place.  The new passenger yard loop track was built to higher
standards on three-quarter inch plywood, so having track on the far
side of it was no longer possible due to low clearance.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="MITCo1982.jpg"><IMG
SRC="MITCo1982SM.jpg" TITLE="MITCo in 1982"
ALT="MITCo in 1982"></A>
</P>
<P>
This photo shows the hobbled MITCo in 1982, with the new Passenger Yard
in 20E-220 on the left.  The main street track no longer passes under
the P-Yard loop, you can see some remains of the trolley loop in front
of it.  There is temporary track behind the loop that connects to a
former stub track in the interchange yard.  The streetcar line at this
time was a giant loop, rather than the prior loop-to-loop operation.
In the foreground is the three-track mainline (replacing the former
four-track mainline), with the interurban track built by Charles
Robinson in 1958 behind it.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="MITCoTrackApril1984.jpg"><IMG
SRC="MITCoTrackApril1984SM.jpg" TITLE="MITCo Trackwork in 1984"
ALT="MITCo Trackwork in 1984"></A>
</P>
<P>
This photo shows track construction progress in April 1984, taken the
day of the Spring open house.  The new connection to the interchange yard
on the right has been retained, with a new wye added at this end of
the yard.  The track behind the Telephone tower building is active,
along with one leg of the wye, allowing MITCo to run as a giant loop.
The track on the far side of the loop has not been completed yet, it
was still an active project by John Shriver.
</P>
<P>
The sheet of plywood with this loop was removed from the layout when
it was torn down in 1997, and moved to the new layout.  Almost all of
the track on this loop is in use on the new layout.  The switch on the
left was removed, as the Main Street from that point is now
double-track.  The wye was devolved into the double-track spur off the
edge of the layout.  The switch off the back side of the loop, which
then connected to the interurban track, now is used by the
single-track spur off the edge of the layout.  
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="106thSt1985.jpg"><IMG
SRC="106thSt1985SM.jpg" TITLE="New Loop in 1985"
ALT="New Loop in 1985"></A>
</P>
<P>
In this 1985 view, the trackwork is complete, as are many of the
buildings around the 105th and 106th Street loop.  This view is
looking across the interchange yard from room 20E-220.  These
buildings can be seen on the loop on today's MITCo.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="NewLoopPaved1986.jpg"><IMG
SRC="NewLoopPaved1986SM.jpg" TITLE="New Loop in 1986"
ALT="New Loop in 1986"></A>
</P>
<P>
In this 1986 view, the paving of the street is complete, and the
sidewalks are in, but the trolley poles and wire have not been
installed yet.  Again, the buildings around the loop are even more
complete.
</P>
<H2>
BITCo
</H2>
<P>
As seen before, the original Charles Robinson MITCo had an interurban
line that passed over the TNP mainline to what came to be known as
North Bassex.  In 1956, this was named BITCo, which stands for Bassex
Industrial Terminal Company.
</P>
<H3>
First BITCo, About 1965-1988
</H3>
<P>
The track in North Bassex (but not the trackwork over the mainline)
was replaced in the mid-1960s by a complicated industrial freight area
designed by Clark Frazier, and mostly built by Bruce Bardes.  It was a
weaving mass of freight trackwork, party in street, partly off-street.
It served numerous industrial buildings, with some spurs going into or
under buildings.  There was also a multiple-track passenger station,
with a wye for turning equipment.
</P>
<P>
The track design was very nice.  The scenery and buildings never
really caught up with the trackwork, so it always looked rather raw.
The track itself was all code 70, with minimal to no guard rails, much
in pavement.  The trackwork wasn't very precise, and the lack of guard
rails with pavement led to very derailment-prone track.  There was a
diamond crossing between two spur tracks that was just unusably bad.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="BITCo1979.jpg"><IMG SRC="BITCo1979SM.jpg"
ALT="BITCO Overall View 1979" TITLE="BITCo Overall View 1979"></A>
</P>
<P>
This 1979 picture above gives an overall view of BITCo.  The passenger
terminal is on the left, with the wye in the foreground.  The
industrial trackwork extends back from there.  The passenger terminal,
the Digital Widgets building on the left and the Coca Bubblie plant on
the right were the only complete buildings for many years.
</P>
<P>
Access to the track was a big problem.  Access to the track was partly
from theedge of the layout, and partly from three different access
holes.  The primary access hole was the operator's position, hidden
behind the Digital Widgets building.  It was excruciatingly small,
about 16 by 20 inches, not really a problem if you had a youthful 32
inch waist, but quite unpleasant if you swollen to a 42 inch waist.
The throttle was mounted on the bottom edge of the access hole, the
block toggles were under the layout just within reach.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="BITCoAccessHole1982.jpg"><IMG SRC="BITCoAccessHole1982SM.jpg"
ALT="Tiny Access Hole for BITCo, 1982"></A>
</P>
<P>
This 1982 photo shows a view of BITCo looking from the windows across the
operator's access hole.  You can see the track plan hanging in the
hole.  To the left of Coca Bubblie is the aluminum frame of a building
that remained in that state for probably 20 years, which came to be
informally known as the aluminum plant.  The brick walls sat on top of
the building until windows were finally created, and the walls glued
on.
</P>
<P>
Operators generally only used the track that they could reach from
that access hole, as having the equipment stall out of reach, or
derail, was just too hard to deal with.  
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="Overall1982.jpg"><IMG SRC="Overall1982SM.jpg" ALT="Overall
View of BITCo and Layout, 1982" TITLE="Overall View of BITCo and
Layout, 1982"></A>
</P>
<P>
This is another view on the same day in 1982.  BITCo is in the
foreground, and you can see all three of the access holes.  You can
see the fourth track of the four-track mainline cut off.  To the right
at the lowest level is the Doxsee Spider, a track area so named
because eight different tracks converged on a six-inch long peice of
straight track.  To the right of that is window siding, also known as
Burns hill.
</P>
<P>
Overhead wire never reached all the track in BITCo.  It served the
main track, the passenger terminal, and the run-around track.  So an
electric locomotive could haul over a block of cars from the
interchange yard, but local switching had to use a small diesel
locomotive.
</P>
<H3>
Second BITCo, About 1988-1997
</H3>
<P>
The second BITCo was built by John Purbrick.  It was designed to be
operated from the edge of the layout, and was built about the time the
angle of the classification yard of the frieght yard next door was
changed, both allowing the operator to walk further "into" the layout.
It provided a simpler passenger terminal, and a much simpler set of
freight tracks.  While it was less complicated and rich than the
original BITCo, it was much more practical with walk-in access from
the edge of the layout.  It was made possible the re-orientation of
the ladder tracks for the frieght yard.
