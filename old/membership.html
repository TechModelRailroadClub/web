<B><I>Want to become a member?</B></I>

First, tell us who you are:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#student">MIT Student</A> (Regular Membership)
<LI><A HREF="#professor">MIT Professor or Staff Member</A> (Regular Membership)
<LI><A HREF="#alum">MIT Alum</A> (Associate or Guest Membership)

<P>
Membership at TMRC is governed by our <A HREF="const/const.html">
Constitution</A> and <A HREF="const/bylaws.html">Bylaws</A>.
A nice English version of these 'legal' documents is below 
(read these ones, they're easier to understand!).
<P>
Be sure to <A HREF="visit.html">visit</A> the clubroom and meet the
members, so that they can answer any more questions you may have about
membership and what we do.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="student">
<H1>MIT Students</H1>

<B>Students:</B>
<P>
<B>Eligibility.</B><BR>
Membership is open to all MIT students.  Just <A HREF="visit.html">come by the club room</A> and ask about membership.
<P>
<B>What does membership get you?</B><BR>
If you become a member of TMRC you can take on any project
you want on the layout, which can be anything from construction to scenery
or electronics.  Only MIT students can be Governors and Treasurer, which
means that you can be one to guide the club through the construction of our
new layout.  As a member of TMRC you will become part of over 60 years of
history at MIT.
<P>
<B>Fees</B><BR>
There is no membership fee for student members. In addition, you will get
a free T-Shirt ($10 value!).
<P>
<B>Keys</B><BR>
Once you join the club and contribute 10 hours of work you can get the code to the door.  This allows you to use the clubroom whenever you want.

<HR>
<A NAME="professor">
<H1>MIT Professors or Staff</H1>

<B>Eligibility.</B><BR>
As a member of the MIT community you can become a member of the club by
just wanting to be part of it.  There are no special rules or anything like
that, all you need to do is want to join the fun!
<P>
<B>What does membership get you?</B><BR>
As a member of TMRC you get to become part of the team that is building a
brand new layout.  Start a new project, or finish one already began.  You
can work on anything you want, including scenery, construction, track work,
electronics, programming...  plus, you can also become an officer of the
club (except Governor or Treasurer), and be even more involved in the club!
<P>
<B>Fees</B><BR>
The membership fee for staff and professors is $15.00 per term.
<P>
<B>Keys</B><BR>
Because you are part of the MIT community, you can get the door code, so that you can visit the room whenever you want.  Just contribute
10 hours of service, either with operation or construction.  After 10 hours
of work you can get the code for the door.

<HR>
<A NAME="alum">
<H1>MIT Alum</H1>

<B>Eligibility.</B><BR>
If you are an alum of MIT then you are eligible to become an "Associate
Member" if you were a member of TMRC at any time during your studies at
MIT, or a "Guest Member" if not.  If you were a student member once, then
you can automatically become an associate member after a simple vote in a
regular meeting (no nomination necessary).  If you were never a member,
then you need a current member to sponsor you.
<P>
<B>What does membership get you?</B><BR>
As either, you are entitled to almost all
privileges of any other member, except for being President or Treasurer
(reserved for students), or to have a key to the clubroom, since you are
not part of the MIT community any more (and MIT rules don't allow it).  But
you can still join any committee, work on any project, and have lots of fun!
<P>
<B>Fees</B><BR>
The membership fee for alumni is $20.00 per term.

<HR>
<A NAME="junior">
<H1>Junior Guest members</H1>

At this time we are unable to offer new junior guest memberships.  Should this change in the future, it will be reflected here. The information below describes the policies and procedures which were in place in the past and which would likely be used should be accept junior guest members again.<p>

<B>Eligibility.</B><BR>
Anybody in Middle or High school (grades 6-12) is eligible for membership at the
clubroom.  We are happy to welcome any of the smart kids that attend
special programs at MIT! <BR>
Junior Guest members need to be approved for membership at one of the
regular club meetings.  This happens after the junior person asks 
a governor to nominate him for membership.  If the current club members agree,
the person can become a junior guest member.
<P>
<B>What does membership get you?</B><BR>
As a junior guest member you can take on many projects in the club, that
include scenery, construction, and many other things.  One of the members
will always be around to help you, and make sure that you are safe.  As
a member that means you have access to all of the club's equipment, which
can operate any time a regular member is there to help you out.
<P>
<B>Fees.</B><BR>
The membership fee for a junior guest member is $5.00 per term.

<HR>
<A NAME="other">

<B>Eligibility.</B><BR>
At TMRC we have "Guest Memberships" in order to let people from around the
MIT area, who are not directly related to MIT, become official club
members and be able to help out in the many club projects.  To become a
guest member you should show up to the clubroom in a regular basis and get involved in some of the projects going on at the club.
 At one of the
regular club meetings you can be nominated for membership by a club governor, and by a simple majority vote,
become part of the club.  Then, each year your membership gets renewed if
you continue to be a good member.
