<h2><a name="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p class="prose">When the Tech Model Railroad Club
(TMRC) moved its layout from its former location in MIT's
Building 20 to the new location in Building N52, the club brought
along the relay-operated control system that had served the club
for nearly 35 years. While reliable, this system (System 2) was
physically large, not easily expandable, and lacked many desirable
features that could easily be accomplished with an electronic
system.</p>

<p class="prose">As a first step in developing a new
electronic system (System 3), the club (principally John Purbrick)
designed a circuit that would allow a computer to operate switches
(turnouts) on the layout. James Knight and Alvar Saenz-Otero did
the printed circuit board layout. To control cost and risk, it was
decided that these cards would not contain microprocessors, but
rather would respond to streams of bytes transmitted from a central
interface message processor (IMP).</p>

<p class="prose">Card size was also chosen on the basis
of cost and risk. Since many integrated circuits come with eight
buffers or drivers in each package, and since track switches often
occur in clusters, it was decided that the best card size was one
that served eight switches. In addition, it was felt desirable to
provide outputs on the card that could operate wayside signals via
control information passed from a master computer through the IMP.
For this purpose, the standard switch card includes eight
general-purpose outputs in addition to the outputs used to operate
track switches. Finally, it was envisioned that push buttons at the
side of the layout might be used under some circumstances, so the
standard switch card includes eight general-purpose inputs.</p>

<p class="prose">While this document emphasizes the
design of a standard switch card, the switch card bus and protocol
described can be used for other types of card.</p>

<h2><a name="transmit">2. Transmitting Data to the Switch
Cards</a></h2>

<p class="prose">All data transmitted to the switch
cards originates in the IMP and is transmitted serially over a bus
that connects all of the switch cards. One of the signals on the
bus is a clock that latches each transmitted bit into the shift
registers on all of the switch cards simultaneously. Thus, at any
given moment, all of the shift registers contain the same
information.</p>

<p class="prose">The bus conveys four signals, the
first three of which are described in this section. Received Data
is described in <a href="#receive">4. Receiving Data from the Switch
Cards.</a></p>

<p class="prose">In the figure, the IMP is sending a
three-byte message, ABC<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=
"">[1]</a>, onto the switch card bus. The bytes are being transmitted
serially (a bit at a time) over the transmit data lead. The clock
signal is clocking the data into the shift registers within each of
the three switch cards shown. The TMRC standard switch cards have
three 8-bit shift registers that are concatenated to form a 24-bit
shift register. However, as shown in the figure, the size of the
shift registers on each card need not be the same. If a shift
register is longer than the bit stream, some portion is unused. If
the shift register is shorter than the bit stream sent, the initial
bits sent are lost. (At startup, the IMP is given configuration
information that tells it how many bytes can be sent to each card.)
For simplicity, the figures that follow describe only the case of
three-byte messages and three-byte shift registers.</p>

<div class="center"><img width="540" height="244" src="image2.gif"></div>
 

<p class="prose">Each of the shift registers shown is a
<i>double-buffered</i> shift register (74HC595) having an eight-bit
shift register section and an eight-bit &#8220;output
register&#8221; section into which the bits can be loaded (in
parallel) when shifting has ceased. When the IMP has finished
sending the last byte of a message, it issues a Strobe signal that
performs the parallel load of the output registers. However, in
each switch card, byte C is the only register connected to the
Strobe line. Thus, the Strobe signal issued by the IMP only
performs a parallel load for the last byte received. Once loaded,
the eight bits of byte C, now on the output pins of the 74HC595
chip, are compared to the card address that is specified by DIP
switches on the card. A 74HC688 8-bit comparator chip performs this
operation. If the last byte received matches the card address, the
comparator performs a parallel loading operation for the other
bytes received earlier in the message - in this case, bytes A and
B. The parallel loading of bytes A and B updates the output signals
for the card shown at left. For the card shown at right, there are
no changes in the outputs, as that card's address did not
match the last byte sent.</p>

<h2><a name="outputs">3. Outputs</a></h2>

<p class="prose">The standard TMRC switch card contains
three shift registers. One of these is used for address
recognition, as explained above. The other two provide a total of
16 outputs, eight of which are connected to driver circuits that
operate small relays on the board. These relays contain contacts
that operate switch machines and contacts that change the polarity
of switch frogs. (When a switch is thrown to the left, the frog
power must come from the right hand rail, and when the switch is
thrown to the right, the frog power must come from the left hand
rail. The switch machines contain contacts that can do this, but
they are not felt to be adequately reliable.)</p>

<p class="prose">The switch card relays were donated to
TMRC, and the card was designed around them. Some are double-pole,
double-throw, and some are quadruple-pole, double-throw. Luckily,
the two types are compatible in layout. For simple switch
installations, a double-pole, double-throw relay is used, with the
two contacts respectively serving the switch motor and the frog.
When a crossover is installed (two switches connecting parallel
tracks) a quadruple-pole, double-throw relay allows control of the
two motors and the two frogs. (See <a href="#additional">6. Additional
Information</a> for further details on switch motor wiring.)</p>

<p class="prose">The remaining eight outputs are
connected to a DIP socket that provides the following
capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li class="prose">If a driver chip (similar to the
ULN2805 driver that controls the relays) is installed, extra relays
located off the board can be driven.</li>

<li class="prose">If a resistor pack is installed in
the socket, trackside signal circuitry can be driven.</li>
</ul>

<p class="prose">A 9-pin connector carries signals away
from the board if either of the above options is in use.</p>

<p class="prose">The second item in the above list
merits further explanation. The outputs of the shift register
(CMOS, not TTL) are very close to +5 Volts for the 1 state and very
close to ground for the 0 state. There is space on the board for
analog circuitry on the board to create a <i>pseudo ground</i>
signal of approximately +2.5 Volts. Use of three voltage levels
becomes important when one considers the operation of a red/green
bi-color LED. Such a device lights red if one lead is more positive
than the other and lights green if that lead is less positive than
the other. If a shift register output lead and the pseudo ground
lead (2.5 Volts) are wired to a bi-color LED, the shift register
output lead can be either more positive (+5) or more negative
(zero) than the pseudo ground. Thus, eight leads and one pseudo
ground lead can turn eight bi-color LEDs red or green individually,
depending on the data received. Further, if the state of the logic
output is changed sufficiently rapidly (80 times per second or a 40
Hz cycle frequency), the LED appears to be yellow. The frequency of
packet transmission was selected to match this 40Hz
requirement.</p>

<p class="prose">The data rate over the bus was chosen
from among the standard selections available in the IMP processor
(PIC16F877), with the requirement that all packets must be
completed within a 1/80 second window. A frequency of 312.5KHz was
selected.</p>

<p class="prose">At start-up, the Server tells the IMP
which addresses are in use and how they are configured. The IMP
loads this information into a RAM chip. The same chip is used for
configuration data (i.e. which addresses are in use, and the number
of data bytes associated with each) and the actual states of all
the controlled outputs. The IMP is programmed to drive all of the
information within its RAM to all of the switch cards 80 times per
second.</p>

<p class="prose">While the preceding description has
emphasized the standard TMRC switch card, the switch card bus
protocol can be used to operate custom cards. In particular, TMRC
has a signal bridge with ten signal heads that uses a custom,
hand-wired interface that obeys the bus protocol. It does not have
any relays, but rather has ten LED driver circuits.</p>

<h2><a name="receive">4. Receiving Data from the Switch
Cards</a></h2>

<p class="prose">The IMP can receive eight bits of data
from any of the TMRC standard switch cards. This function is best
understood by quickly reviewing the transmission of the data to the
switch cards.</p>

<div class="center"><img width="540" height="241" src="image3.gif"></div>
<div class="center"><img width="540" height="245" src="image4.gif"></div>

<p class="prose">The figure above is a slightly
modified version of the previous figure. The IMP has just
transmitted a message (ABC) and has issued a Strobe signal to
transfer the last byte (C) into the output registers on each card.
Each card has compared that byte to its card address. In the
leftmost card shown, the address has matched, and bytes A and B
have also been transferred to their output registers, where they
drive the outputs.</p>

<p class="prose">However, in addition to enabling the
parallel load of bytes A and B, the successful address comparison
also enables a shift register. This shift register is a
parallel-to-serial device that accepts eight data bits in parallel
and shifts them out serially onto the Received Data bus in time
with transitions of the clock line as soon as the clock signal
resumes.</p>

<p class="prose">As indicated in the lower portion of
the figure, when the IMP sends the next message (bytes D, E, and
F), the C bytes from the previous message remain in place
controlling their respective address comparator circuits, as no
Strobe signal has yet been issued. Thus, although bytes D, E, and F
are shifted onto each card, the leftmost card is enabling input
information onto the Received Data bus, and the clock signal is
clocking it into the IMP. In the example shown, the eight bits of
data being received by IMP are clocked onto the Received Data bus
while the D byte is being transmitted from the IMP to the cards.
Undefined data is clocked onto the Received Data bus while the E
and F bytes are transmitted to the cards. The transfer of undefined
data onto the Received Data bus occurs whenever the number of input
registers (bytes) on a card is less than the number of output bytes
transmitted to the next card being addressed.</p>

<p class="prose">The number of input registers (bytes)
on a card may be greater than the number of output bytes required
by the next card being addressed. To ensure there are sufficient
clock pulses to shift out the contents of the input registers, the
IMP must send more bytes to the next card than that card requires.
For example, if the leftmost card in the preceding diagram had been
equipped with input registers for six bytes, the next message sent
could have been XXXDEF, with the last byte sent (F) being the
address byte for that transmission, and DE being the data bytes.
The XXX string (sent first) would be lost, having been sent merely
to provide enough clocking for the IMP to receive the input data
from the six input registers on the leftmost card.</p>

<p class="prose">It is also possible that the number of
input registers on a card equals the number of output bytes
required by the next card. In that case, no undefined input data is
received and no extraneous data is transmitted to the next card
addressed.</p>

<h2><a name="cabling">5. Cabling</a></h2>

<p class="prose">The switch card bus uses EIA-422
interface technology, specifically AM26LS31 drivers and AM26LS32
receivers. EIA-422 is a differential signaling system employing a
pair of wires for each signal conveyed. One wire contains an
inverted version of the other signal, and information is conveyed
by the difference between the two wires.&#160; Thus, if both
signals V<sub>+</sub> and V<sub>-</sub> have an interfering signal
X added, the difference (V<sub>+</sub>+X) - (V<sub>-</sub>+X)
equals (V<sub>+</sub> - V<sub>-</sub>), and the interfering signal
has been canceled out. To ensure that each wire receives equal
noise exposure, the two wires are twisted together.</p>

<p class="prose">The IMP is the only device that can
drive the Transmit Data, Strobe, and Clock leads. Only the card
that recognizes its address when Strobe is asserted in an
IMP-to-card transmission sequence can drive the Received Data lead
during the data clocking interval that precedes the next Strobe
signal. See <a href="#receive">4. Receiving Data from the Switch
Cards</a>.</p>

<p class="prose">The TMRC application uses four pair in
an eight-twisted-pair ribbon cable that has an untwisted (flat)
section every 18 inches. A standard mass-termination socket can be
applied at any of the flat spots, and the socket can be plugged
into a PC board-mounted header. No cable-cutting or soldering is
required.</p>

<h2><a name="additional">6. Additional Information</a></h2>

<p class="prose">The switch motors are operated with
one side always connected to ground, and the other side switched by
one of the switch relay's contacts to either +12 or -12
volts. The question is sometimes asked why the two power supplies
are needed. It is certainly possible to control a motor
bi-directionally with a single voltage, but doing so requires two
&#8220;double-throw&#8221; contacts arranged as a &#8220;reversing
bridge&#8221;. Since there are only two such contacts available for
each track switch, and one contact is used to control track power
to the switch frog, only one double-throw contact is available to
control the motor. Thus, dual power supplies are required.</p>
