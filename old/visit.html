<A Name="contact"><H2>Contact</H2>
<p>
The best ways to contact TMRC are via the <A HREF=#email>email</A> addresses on this page.  Alternately you can <A HREF="#address">call or send the club non-electronic mail</A>.  
<p>
<H2>Visiting TMRC</H2>

<p><big><b>Note:</b> The Club is in the process of <em>resuming</em> regular meetings as of Jan. 2023. If you see our lights on, come in and say hi. Otherwise reach out via email for more information!</big>

<p>Everybody is welcome to visit TMRC.  We are happy to receive visitors as follows:
<UL>
<LI><strike>Saturdays, 6:00 pm to 11:00 pm (with a dinner break around 7:00pm-8:00pm)</strike>
<LI><strike>We have a regular work night on Wednesdays, 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm, but we aren't ready to display the layout or show visitors around then. We're always happy to meet MIT students, but we ask all others to confine visits to Saturdays. </strike>
<LI> If you're in Cambridge briefly and can't get here on a Saturday, contact us and we may be able to arrange something.
</UL>
<P>
While someone is usually at the club during those times, it isn't guaranteed, especially during holidays or summer break.  Nor is it guaranteed that the layout will be in working order.  To be sure you don't make the trip for nothing, give us a call
before you come.  Within MIT, dial extension <B>x3-3269</B>, or outside MIT
call <B>(617) 253-3269</B>.

<H3>How to get to TMRC</H3>

<A HREF="images/n52small.gif">
<IMG SRC="images/n52small.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=450></A>

TMRC is located on the first floor of the MIT museum buliding, room <A HREF="http://whereis.mit.edu/map-jpg?selection=N52&amp;Buildings=go">N52-118</A> in MIT's numbering scheme, a few blocks north of the main campus at 265 Massachusetts
Avenue.  We're across the street from a Sunoco gas station that's between Random Hall and the former Necco Building (now owned by Novartis).  You get to the club through a <A HREF="images/FrontDoor.jpg">silver door</A> located to the right of the main entrance to the MIT Museum.  To the right of the door are a campus phone and emergency call box.  If the door is locked, call the clubroom on the campus phone (dial 3-3269).  Don't use the emergency call box or you'll annoy the campus police.   
<P>
Getting to the clubroom from the main campus is easy.  Walk north along Massachusetts Avenue.  The building will be on the right side of the street, just past the bicycle shop and across from the Sunoco gas station.
<P>
The club can also be reached by some of the campus shuttle lines, including the Cambridge East Saferide (use the Random Hall stop, and cross the street to reach TMRC), the Cambridge West Saferide (use the Star Market stop and walk a couple of  blocks), and the Northwest Shuttle (use the MIT museum stop).  Check with the <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/shuttles/index.html">transportation office</A> for current schedules and route maps. 
<P>
<B>By T (subway)</B>
<P>
Take the <A HREF="http://www.mbta.com/">MBTA</A> Red Line subway to the Central Square station. Exit the station and head south towards Boston / the Charles River.
Walk about 5 blocks south until you reach the MIT Museum
Building on the left side of the street, across from the Sunoco station.
<P>
<B>By Car</B>
<P>
If you're unfamiliar with the area, we suggest you consult <A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=265+massachusetts+avenue,+cambridge,+ma+02139&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=47.751524,62.138672&amp;layer=&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=addr">google maps</A>, another mapping service, or perhaps an old-fashioned paper map for directions to the club.
<P>
Street parking is generally available nearby, subject to whatever rules Cambridge chooses to impose.  There are also a couple of <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/facilities/transportation/parking/index.html">MIT parking lots</A> nearby, one directly behind the building, and another semi-paved lot across Windsor street.   While it is technically illegal to park in these lots without a permit, you are unlikely to get ticketed after 5 p.m. or on weekends.  With that said, the fine men and women of the MIT police department have been known to ticket permitless cars parked in these lots on an infrequent basis, even at night and on weekends, and we can't help you if you get ticketed.

The club room phone number is (617) 253-3269 - this is a good option if you can call during one of our scheduled meetings.  While we have an answering machine, it isn't always checked in a timely fashion.  You'll get a faster response via email or the web form.
