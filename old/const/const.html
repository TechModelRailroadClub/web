<H1>
Article 4. Change of Government</H1>

<H2>
Section A.</H2>
A Change of Government is called for by a two-thirds vote of the Assembly;
by a majority of the officers posting notice thereof; automatically at
12:01 A.M. October 31 and April 1; and when there are no Governors. Election
for Governors shall occur at the same meeting during which this Constitution
is adopted.
<H2>

Section B.</H2>
At the first meeting called to order following a call for a Change of
Government by at least six days, it shall be moved, either from the floor
or automatically, that: "Resolve that the present Government be sustained."
The Motion to Sustain passes if two-thirds of those voting vote in favor.
Otherwise an election for Governors shall immediately be held.
<H2>
Section C.</H2>
Nominations for Governors shall be verbal and from the floor. At least
three persons shall be nominated. Each nominee shall be an M.I.T. student,
and a member qualified to possess a key to the Clubroom, as defined in
the By-Laws. Election shall be by secret ballot. The top two candidates
become Governors. If first place is clear, but there is a tie for second,
the top runner becomes one Governor, and another ballot is held on the
remaining candidates: the top runner there becomes the other Governor.
In all other ties the bottom runner is eliminated and another ballot is
taken if a choice remains. (Interpretation by the Chair 11-6-65: Vote for
two candidates on the ballot.)

<H2>
Section D.</H2>
The Governors assume all their power, including presiding, immediately
at the close of their election. When the two Governors have been elected,
they must, in a report to the Assembly at the following meeting, propose
their Government, describing the title, duties, and name of each of the
proposed officeholders. The report must bear the signatures of all the
proposed officers. The Government must also meet the specifications of
Article 5 below. At that meeting the Assembly must vote on the motion:
"Resolve, that the Club accept the Government proposed by governors ---
and ---." If this Motion to Accept is carried, the Government takes power
at the adjournment of the meeting. If the vote fails, or a thoroughly valid
report is not given, the Assembly must at that time elect a new pair of
Governors, who must not have been Governors together previously during
the same Change of Government. However, the Governors may once appeal for
a secret ballot to give them one additional month to prepare a Government.

<H2>
Section E.</H2>
Should a Governor cease to satisfy the conditions for his nomination, he
ceases to be a Governor. Should a Governor resign or become ineligible,
this fact shall be reported to the Assembly by himself or the other Governor,
and at the regular meeting following said notice a replacement shall be
elected by secret ballot.

the meeting.

<H2>
Section B.</H2>
The person presiding may vote in all elections for Governor, officers,
membership, and other posts or honors established by the Constitution or
By-Laws. He may vote on the motion to sustain the present Government, on
Amendments to the Constitution or By-Laws, and on motions to frown or smile.
Otherwise he may vote only to resolve a tie, and then not if the vote was
taken by secret ballot.

<H2>
Section C.</H2>
Quorum at meetings shall be as determined in the By-Laws.

<H2>
Section D.</H2>
General meetings of the Assembly shall be held throughout the Fall and
Spring terms. These meetings shall be held monthly, the second Saturday
of the month at 8:00pm in the Club room. The meetings shall not require
formal announcement other than as described in Section F. If a meeting
will have a date/time/location other than as described above, the change
must be clearly announced at least a week prior to the meeting, putting
especial emphasis on the change.

<H2>
Section E.</H2>
When a meeting is to be held at which there is to be a vote (other than
the first vote) on an amendment to the Constitution or By-Laws, or an Election
of Governors, or a Vote to Accept, notice of that meeting and the nature
thereof shall be posted in a prominent location in the Clubroom for a period
of five (5) days before the meeting. When a meeting is to be held at which
there is to be a first vote on an amendment to the Constitution or By-Laws,
the notice period shall be ten (10) days. All announcements must include
the posting date in the format mm/dd/yy.

<H2>
Section F.</H2>
Notice of the meetings and agendas shall be posted in a specially designated
space of the Club Room. This space shall be used solely for this purpose
and shall not be erased other than to announce the next meeting. The space
must be updated at the end of each meeting to announce the next regularly
scheduled general meeting and must be updated with any business or emergency
meetings.


<H1>
Article 7. Replacement of Officers</H1>

<H2>
Section A.</H2>
By a two-thirds vote the Assembly may call for the replacement of an Officer;
the Governors shall decide upon a replacement and report same to the Assembly
at the next meeting. Failing such report the Assembly must choose a replacement
at that meeting.

<H2>
Section B.</H2>
The Governors may replace any officer by posting notice thereof. At the
next meeting they must report same to the Assembly and the Assembly may
reject, by two-thirds vote, the replacement. Should the report not be given,
or the replacement be rejected, the office then reverts to its prior holder.
The Treasurer holds office until the replacement is accepted by the Assembly;
all other duties are transferred when notice is posted.

<H2>
Section C.</H2>
The replacement of the holder of any particular office for the second time
in less than two weeks, or the third time in less than two months, or when
any two other replacements have occurred within two weeks, or any change
in the structure of the Government, can only be done upon report of the
Governors and approval of the Assembly, except that a Change of Government
nullifies the applicability to this section of any replacements thereto.


<H1>
Article 8. Responsibility for the Affairs of the Club</H1>

<H2>
Section A.</H2>
To all officers in meeting is given the power of deliberation on proposed
projects, membership offences, and general Club policy. Each Government
shall hold such a meeting at least once a month except that a Government
formed within the last six days of such a calendar month need not meet
that month. Quorum for such meetings shall be three-fifths of the officers.

<H2>
Section B.</H2>
During the period between the election of Governors and the approval of
a Government, the affairs of the Club are managed by the Governors, subject
to review and direction by majority vote of the Assembly; except that the
Treasurer shall hold office until his replacement is approved by the Assembly.
<P>
During the Summer, authority is delegated as specified in Article 9 below.
<P>
At all other times the most recently chosen officers are in charge. Each
officer is responsible for promulgating, in written form, all the rules
he chooses to enforce in the matters over which he has jurisdiction. These
rules may be overruled only by a three-quarters vote of the Assembly, but
all commitments or expenditures of funds over the "maximum pre-approved
expense" (as defined in 5.B.B.1.c) must first be approved
by a governor and the treasurer. Likewise the Assembly must approve any
project that would, in the opinion of either Governor or of one-third of
the officers, substantially change the appearance of the layout or Clubroom
or the mode of operation of the layout. These rules are in any case subject
to the Constitution, By-Laws, and previous overruling votes of the Assembly.


<H1>
Article 9. The Summer Board</H1>
At any of the last three meetings of the Assembly in each spring term,
it shall be moved: "Resolve, that the Club elect a Summer Board with a
budget of --- plus --- percent of the income earned during the previous
administration." Should this motion pass, members who shall be resident
in the Cambridge area during the coming summer are nominated from the floor.
As each is nominated, the Assembly votes on them. A two-thirds vote in
favor of a person elects him to the Summer Board. Also each Governor is
automatically on the Summer Board if he will be in the area. If by the
end of the spring term a Summer Board has been formed with at least three
members, that board takes power upon close of class. The Board may, at
a meeting of which all Board members have been notified in time to attend,
by a majority vote approve projects and expenditures, not to exceed their
budget. Their power ceases at the first regular meeting of the Assembly
in the fall term. Should a proper Board not exist at the close of a spring
term, then a project of expenditure shall be undertaken in the Summer only
as approved by the Assembly during that spring term.


<H1>
Article 10. Amendments and Interpretation</H1>

<H2>
Section A. Definitions</H2>
"The active membership" consists of all regular members plus all associate
members voting.

<P>"Posting notice" consists of putting a written notice, signed by both
Governors or by a majority of the officers, as appropriate, in the proper
place in the Clubroom. A conspicuous location shall be reserved for such
notices, and another for the most recent minutes.

<P>"A report" by the Governors to the Assembly must be in writing, signed
by both Governors, and presented at the proper time in the meeting.

<P>"The duration of a Change of Government" is from the failure of a Motion
to Sustain until the passage of a Motion to Accept.

<H2>
Section B. Amendments.</H2>
This Constitution may be amended by two-thirds vote of the Assembly at
each of three successive meetings, except that the duties set forth in
Article 5 may be augmented or clarified in the same manner as the By-Laws
are amended.

<H2>
Section C. Interpretation.</H2>
Any question of the interpretation of this Constitution shall be determined
by the person presiding, subject to a two-thirds overruling vote by the
Assembly.


<H1>
Article 11.Location of the Official Constitution</H1>
The official Constitution and Bylaws of the Club shall reside in the Club's
Athena locker. The files must be in .html format, or that format universally
recognized by the ASA at the time, and must be publicly available over
the WWW. The Constitution shall be named <I>const.html</I> and the By-Laws
<I>bylaws.html</I>. No other versions of the documents shall be official;
any amendments or changes to the constitution or By-Laws shall be effective
as of their posting date and time into the official electronic versions.
An updated hard copy of the Constitution and By-Laws must always be kept
in the club room posted next to the membership list and in a visible and
accessible area.
