3) Governor Reports

DML reports our successful open hours. The system worked very well, possibly flawlessly. The trackwork also worked well. Hardly any noticeable track issues, except for the decoupler in Bermanville. The rails were inexplicably slipperier than usual such that the pulling power of the locomotives was less than expected. Several amusing decouplings, including an A unit detaching from a B unit and outpacing the train, still being pulled by the B unit.

DML would like to congratulate the maintenance people who cleaned the floor. They did an amazing job.

QEJS (ACM) moves to smile on the maintenance people. MPWB

4) EAMOTFSMITC
