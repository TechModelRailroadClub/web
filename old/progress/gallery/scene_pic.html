<B>Vegetable Oil Facility</B><BR>
This is the building that Bill Onorato is constructing.  Note the
complex shape of it, which makes it much harder to build than a
standard rectangular building.  It has a slope down its side, and
is angled in the middle.  The track behind it is on a curve!

This is the first double cross over at TMRC, completely hand built by

This used to be the old Tuckerton terminal, but will now become the
center piece of the new Gifford City.  It is the terminal where all passenger
service will originate for the TNP cars.  It is scheduled to be refurbished
by the next Open House, so that it can be shown in all its glory!

A great picture of the 50th anniversary, special Time Capsule Edition,
car on a track right next to the Round House.  The locomotive next to it
the old Aaron Burr power, which has been called off service.

A top view of the turn-table, and actually one of the nicest.  You can
see John McNamara working hard on the refurbishing and completion of the
Round House.  A lot more pictures on his work below.

In this picture note the incredible color matching and joint hiding
achieved by John McNamara.  His long hours of testing definitely paid off!

<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>105th St</B><BR>
After ardous work, the bridge for 105th station is now built.  This
picture shows it one week before it was painted, so pardon the many
colors in it :-)  With this bridge in place, it is actually the first
time in TNP history that pedestrians will actually be able to access
the platform without having to cross the tracks!
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/105thStBridge2.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/105thStBridge2SM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>105th St</B><BR>
Note how the bridge had two very different sections.  The outside
part is a Pony Truss bridge, which crosses mainline.  The other
section is a standard thru girder bridge, which goes over the
siding.  This combination was chosen to give the bridge extra
life, especially since it crossed two differents kinds of tracks.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/105thStBridge3.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/105thStBridge3SM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>

Another look at the 105th St bridge.

<IMG SRC="scene/105thSt-stairSM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>105th St</B><BR>
Note the detail in the staircase, including the central resting
section, and the handrail at the top of the staircase, which goes
around the diagonal in order to prevent people from hitting their
heads!
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/Underpass.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/UnderpassSM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>105th St</B><BR>
This pedestrian tunnel was though of by Alvar, who figured out that the
best way to connect the two sidewalks and still allow for the bridge, was
to make something similar that what the MBTA "T" did in the Lechmere T Stop
in Cambridge.  The underpass connects both side of the sidewalk, while
allowing the street to go up and over to connect into the 105th street
station.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/JPBridge.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/JPBridgeSM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>100th St Bridge</B><BR>
This is the bridge being built by John P.  It will be a thru
girder bridge all across, and you can already see how it has two
trolley tracks going through it!  That means that some day it will
have overhead wire across the removable bridge!  We'll have to figure
out how to do that...
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/WPABridge1.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/WPABridge1SM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>77th St Bridge</B><BR>
Another bridge by Andy!!!  This is a 40's style bridge, with concrete
sidings and heavy steel construction underneath; all supported by
concrete columns.  It is the longest bridge out of Gifford city, and
as such will get some kind of recognition...
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/WPABridge2.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/WPABridge2SM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>77th St Bridge</B><BR>
Another view of the bridge.  If you look carefully at the part right
over the track you'll notice the detail of 'black smoke' on the
side of the handrails!
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/ASMTruss1.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/ASMTruss1SM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>Main St Bridge</B><BR>
This is the Main St bridge built by Andy.  It was the first bridge
finished in the layout, and it is quite impressive.  Since the two
abatments were not parallel, the bridge has different sides, which made
it harder to build.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/ASMTruss2.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/ASMTruss2SM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>Main St Bridge</B><BR>
In this picture you can see the 'irregulaties' of the bridge
much better.  Note how neither of the ends align, and how the closes
diagonal is different than the other ones! All these made the bridge
quite a challenge!
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/Warehouse1.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/Warehouse1SM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>Warehouse</B><BR>
This is the warehouse being built by John Purbrick.  He has prepared
most of the sections for the warehouse itself, and is now starting work
on the office section next to it.  But to do that he is working on the
street bridge that goes next to it, so that he knows the street level
for the offices.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/Warehouse2.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/Warehouse2SM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">

A more artistic picture of the warehouse, with Gifford City in the
back.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/Warehouse3.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/Warehouse3SM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>Warehouse</B><BR>
A new picture of the Warehouse, where you can see the new 'curtain'
insalled, to keep the cold in and the heat out.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/CarBarn.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/CarBarnSM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>Carbarn</B><BR>
This is the carbarn for the trolleys.  It comes from the old layout,
and is possitions in its final place for the new layout.  You can
see in the plywood the markings for the ladder that will give
trollyes access to each of the four tracksin the barn.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/MainStNewBldg.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/MainStNewBldgSM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>New Building in Main St</B><BR>
This is Andy's newest building in the layout.  It will go right across
from the large hotel he will work next on.  As you can see the exterior
is done; the interior work will be done after the Open House.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/CapsuleCars.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/CapsuleCarsSM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>Capsule Cars</B><BR>
These are the time capsule cars.  The one in the stand will go in MIT's
Building 20 time capsule.  The on currently on the track will go in a
TMRC built time-capsule.  This car will be run once a year on the day
of the during of the MIT capsule, so that when they get re-united, this
car will have taken 55 loops around the track.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/CapsuleCar.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/CapsuleCarSM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">

<IMG SRC="scene/CapsuleCoverSM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>Capsule Cars</B><BR>
And now you see it with its cover on, in the exact way that it will
be buried for 55 years.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/CapsuleFront.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/CapsuleFrontSM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>Capsule Cars</B><BR>
Another look at the time capsule car in its final configuration.  Now
with the Round House in the background.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="220" ALIGN="center"><A HREF="scene/CapsuleBack.jpg">
<IMG SRC="scene/CapsuleBackSM.jpg" BORDER=0 HSPACE="0"></A></TD>
<TD WIDTH=400 ALIGN="left">
<B>Capsule Cars</B><BR>
This is the back of the Time capsule side.  Especially, note how the
TNP logo is different.  The 'back' of the car has the original TNP logo;
the 'front' has the new one.  The CD-ROM attached to the back has many
references to the club today and its past, including the complete website
as of the Summer of 1998.
