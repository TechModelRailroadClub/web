<P>To MIT students, the Tech Model Railroad Club offers a unique experience.  At one level we're a social club: we meet to see our friends and we go out to dinner every week.  However, we also offer a chance to do some <a href="../hackers-ref.html">hacking</a> with a purpose, to get involved with a real, messy (but small) engineering project that offers a change from abstract P-sets.  Finally, you can contribute something that will be part of MIT for fifty years or more.  That's what these projects are about.
<p>TMRC is a choose-your-own-adventure sort of club.  Our <a href="../TNP/index.html">layout</a> is so huge that there are always half a dozen projects going on somewhere.  There's always benchwork, scenery, trackwork, cars and locomotives, software, electronics, electronics, and electronics to work on.  It's our club rule that nobody <u>has</u> to do anything.  There's no mandatory work of any kind.  Some of our alumnus members haven't done anything useful in years!  Instead, just find something you'd like to do and jump in.  If you don't know how, our club members have experience of all kinds and everyone's willing to offer opinions or assistance.  In the end, not only do you get to hang out with one of the most offbeat and inventive groups of people at MIT, but you can also point to something on the layout and proudly say, "I built that! (Why isn't it working?)"
<P>The following table can give you some ideas.  It shows the major projects going on at TMRC, and some others we'd like to get started.   If you are interested in any of these projects, please e-mail us at: <a href=mailto:tmrc-web@mit.edu>tmrc-web@mit.edu</a>.  Of course, the best way to find out what's going on at TMRC is to <a href="../visit.html">visit</a> one of our regular Wednesday or Saturday evening meetings and talk to us.  We're more than happy to show you around the layout and help you get started on a new project!
<P>

We have a walk-around layout... so we
need walk around cabs.  Help us cut the cord
and control our trains wirelessly!

We need dozens of new signals in the
layout: signal bridges, dwarf signals,
signal towers, etc. Help build current
designs, or make a new one of your
own design.

</a></td>
<td><h3>Track Cleaning Car</h3>
TMRC invented <a href="../dictionary.html#CRUFT">cruft</a>, and we remain
committed to producing plenty of it.  Our rails
get very dirty very quickly, and this can stop
the trains from running.  The solution?  Regular
track cleaning by a dedicated motorized car.
Even better: what if the cleaning car ran over the
layout automatically, like a rail-bound Roomba?
There are all sorts of interesting possibilities with
this project.

<td><h3>Scenery: East Berkmannville</h3>
There are several TNP customers in the east end of Berkmannville that haven't even been planned yet.  There's also a big chemical plant (see below) and a lot of track and ground cover that needs to be finished up.  This is one of those areas where you can do pretty much whatever you like.

The Whatahack River in Gifford City is spanned
by not one but three working lift bridges!
At least it is in our imaginations.  Try your hand
at a moving piece of railroad sculpture!

The TNP's signature passenger trains,
the Aaron Burr and the Benedict Arnold,
are in need of inspection and repair.  
We also have high-speed rail, and 
lots of commuter equipment to build.

Gifford City has a trolley system under
construction. The raised wire is nearly
finished but we need the electronics

<P>These are future projects, which we could put in the front-line if you are interested in them.  These are usually longer-term than those above, but they can be great projects too!

<td><h3>Building Lighting</h3>
One exciting part of having day and night operations is the sight of dozens of buildings lit up from inside.  We have a few built around the layout, but we need more and we need to create the circuit boards to drive them all from our network.

<td><h3>Car Identification</h3>
With over 200 freight cars and 50 locomotives,
keeping track of where everything is can be quite a hassle.
We need a system that allows the computer to find
every train and car on the layout.  Can it be done with RFID?
Something else?  Try to solve this challenging problem!

Someday our main helix is going to go somewhere.
The line from Berkmannville to Tuckerton is still
on the drawing board, so come help us plan and 
design the newest part of the TNP!
