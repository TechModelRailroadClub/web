<H2>Complete July 1986 RMC Article</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I> This page was converted from an article written about the
club which was published as the cover article in the July 1986 issue of
<CITE>Railroad Model Craftsman</CITE> magazine.  It's just a straight linear
exposition.  It has not been checked to see if any of the facts herein
have changed since the time it was written more than a decade ago.  I expect
each of these sections, reworked for Web suitability and verified for
currentness, would make a good page of its own.  </I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Overview</H2>
The Tech Model Railroad Club of MIT (TMRC) is one of the host layouts
for the 1986 NMRA convention in Boston.  The club, an MIT student activity,
was founded in 1946 and within
three years an HO gauge layout was operational.  While the layout has
been continuously operational since that time, it has been expanded
to twice the original size, and the pace of modification has been such
that nearly all of the layout has been rebuilt during the past fifteen
years.  At present, the layout has over two hundred feet of mainline
route, three terminal yards, many industrial sidings, and a separate
trolley system which gets power from the rails or the overhead wire.

<P>

TMRC is not a typical model railroad club for many reasons.
Being primarily an MIT student
organization is probably the biggest influence.  We need to allow
incoming students to operate their own equipment on the club's
track; this limits
the choices for control systems.  Also, we frequently get donations of
electronic equipment
that would be expensive for other clubs to obtain.  This, combined
with the overall technical sophistication of the average member, leads
to quite sophisticated control systems.  The main purpose of the control
system, however, is to provide prototypical operation.



<H2>The Layout</H2>
The club's railroad is the Tech Nickel Plate (TNP) railroad, which is a
pun on the word ``technical'' and the now-defunct NYC&StL which was
known as the ``Nickel Plate''.
The trolley
system's passenger operation is the Messachussetts Interurban Traction
Company (MITCo), and the freight portion is the Bassex Industrial
Terminal Company (BITCo).

<P>

The track plan allows for a variety of operating patterns.  It is designed to
be operated point-to-point for card-order freight and timetable
passenger operation.  Several cutoffs provide for other schemes
including continuous loop for public open houses or casual operation
and point-to-loop for timetable operations with a small number of
operators.

<P>

While the TNP does not model any specific prototype, it
represents part of a Class I railroad connecting a coastal city with
the first inland division point.  As the mainline proceeds from the 
large coastal city (Gifford City) to the division point (Tuckerton), 
it passes through several towns, a small city, and a mountain area.  
The scenery along the way represents the Northeast, and has been modeled 
to create scenes appropriate to a wide range of eras, from late steam to 
modern.

<P>

Gifford City is a terminus containing extensive freight and passenger 
yards with a large roundhouse and engine servicing facility.  This
yard can be run as either a terminal yard or a through loop yard.  The small
city (Sawyer Junction) contains an industrial area with many sidings.
The mountain area includes a sawmill and a long steel viaduct.

<P>

All track and switches are hand-laid with a mixture of codes 100 and 83
for the mainline and codes 70 and 55 for sidings and spurs.
Switches are all custom built in place.  The benchwork utilizes heavy
duty construction capable of supporting the full weight of a person
in most areas.  Most major construction projects are
first built out of position and then installed quickly to limit the
amount of time during which the layout is not operational.

<P>

The scenery is nearly complete on over two thirds of the layout.  The
ground is plaster or wood putty over screen wire or
styrofoam.  Trees are made by many different techniques.
There are over a hundred structures on the layout,
mostly scratchbuilt or extensively kitbashed.  There are many bridges
and tunnels around the layout which have all been scratch-built.


<H2>The Control System</H2>
The mainline control system is automatic progressive cab control.  It
is similar in principle to simple cab control as used on most layouts,
but does not have toggle switches for power routing.
Instead, power is routed by telephone switching equipment, which
automatically controls the connection of cabs to blocks.  This
makes operation more prototypical,
as an engineer controls the speed and
direction of his train from a single operating position,
while a central dispatcher controls train routing.

<P>

The mainline system manages power routing from five cab positions to
fifty mainline blocks, and allows independent operation of all trains.
Cab signals are provided for each operator.
This system is easy for new members and guests to learn to operate, and
operation is simple enough that one person can readily operate more
than one train at a time.
The mainline system is more typically used for operating sessions
with several yard operators, five mainline operators
each controlling a single train, and a dispatcher
controlling turnouts.

<P>

Each yard has an independent control system allowing the yard
operator complete control over speed, direction, and turnout
position.  In addition, the yard control systems
allow trackage within the yard to be set up for operation under
control of the mainline system.  At least two mainline and two yard
locomotives can be operated simultaneously within each yard.

<P>

The Gifford City freight and engine yards operate under computer
control and a similar system is under construction
for the Gifford City passenger yard.
The freight and engine yards have two lighted pushbutton
panels, which allow the operator to push buttons identifying
the two ends of the
desired route, and the computer finds the best available route, and sets up the
power and switches.  The buttons then light to indicate the
route.  Routes controlled by the other panel (or the mainline)
blink in specific patterns.  The computer used is a Digital
Equipment Corporation PDP-11/05 minicomputer, which was donated
by the manufacturer in 1973.



<H2>Trolley Service</H2>
A considerable amount of trolley trackage is woven through the
layout in the Gifford City area.  This operates with a
separate control system designed for trolleys.

<P>

The passenger service provided by MITCo operates in the streets
of Gifford City, with an interurban run to the nearby town
of East Whitney. Freight service is provided over the interurban line
by BITCo, which also has extensive street trackage in East Whitney
serving the local industries.  The interchange with TNP is 
through a small yard where the freights are sorted to simplify switching in
East Whitney.

<P>

The trolley line can operate three trains independently with overhead
or two rail operation.
There are thirty feet of street trackage serving Gifford City and
another thirty feet of interurban trackage serving the East Whitney
industrial area.

<P>

A unique feature of the trolley is the overhead wire, which
is number 31 copper-plated steel wire, rather
than the more commonly used phosphor bronze.  The smaller diameter of
the wire looks better, and the steel inner core gives it enough
strength to prevent stretching and sagging.  For ease of construction
the overhead is not gapped.  Control is done by switching the leads to the
rails.



<H2>Summary</H2>
While the layout is somewhat smaller than usual for a club, the
sophisticated control system allows for fairly dense traffic and a lot
of operating interest.  It also serves as an outlet for students who
wish to have ``hands on'' design of electronic circuitry.  In fact the
club is
<A HREF="../hackers-ref.html">credited</A> with being the birthplace of
computer hacking and computer games.

<P>

The club is primarily for students, faculty, and employees with some
club alumni maintaining continuing membership.  Regular open houses
which are free to the public are held in the Spring and Fall.  The
next is scheduled for April 19, 1986.  Visitors are welcome most any
time the club is open, but it is advisable to call beforehand at
(617)-253-3269.  Although the club activities are not scheduled it is
most likely to find activity on Friday evening and Saturday from
mid-afternoon through evening.

<P>Tuckerton features a traditional large-city passenger station, and even a quiet time at the station has some action-here a through train trades B&M Fs for TNP GPs while a switcher rearranges head-end cars on an adjacent track.  James VanBokkelen photo</P>
