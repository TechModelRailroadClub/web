Welcome to the TMRC videos webpage.  The videos are encoded in a variety of formats, including 
<A HREF="http://www.real.com/products/player/index.html">RealVideo</a>
or <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">Quicktime</a> format, and AVI, so be sure that you have the proper plugin installed.  The newest videos are posted to YouTube, and we'll probably move more videos there soon. If you're curious about how the cab's eye view videos were made, click <A HREF="CameraCars.html">here</A>

There are eleven locations you can get to by clicking around.  Make sure you let the
video load <i>fully</i>, as it won't let you move around until then. (Pressing the

A video taken with TMRC's new camera car on 8/20/2000!
After a lot of work from Jared & Vicky, with Alvar's help, and thanks to
Ben's tutorial on how to improve the quality of the videos, it is here:<BR>
<B>TMRC's Grandson of Cab's Eye View</B>.<BR>
The video transverses the complete layout, starting at the Gifford
side of <B>Staging Yard</B> it goes to the <B>Gifford City</B> bypass, and
out the "West" end of Gifford to the rest of the world.  It goes right by
<B>105th Street</B>, also on the bypass track, and then towards Freight
Yard... but turns around <B>The Tower</B> since FY is not there yet!  And
back it goes to <B>105th Street</B>, now making a schedule stop.  After the
short stop it continues back to <B>Gifford City</B> for another stop; but
before that is passes right next to <I>The Aaron Burr</I>, TNP's top
passenger train.  After a stop at Gifford City <I>Grandson</I> continues
"East" and goes back to <B>Staging</B>, all around, and back to the
starting place.

This footage was shot at the old club room just before the layout was 
disassembled. We used a home made camera car followed by a battery car,
and an engine. The video was then encoded into RealVideo for web use.

An animated GIF of the switchstand, showing how it works. This was derived from a POV-Ray file. POV-Ray (Persistence Of Vision Ray tracing) is a public-domain program which allows rendering of visual scenes. It's lots of fun--and highly addictive!
