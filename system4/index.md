## Features
 - DCC Support
 - LCC Compliant
 - More Compact [Block Cards](block_cards.html) using Arduino Nano-Format Microprocessors (Easily Upgradable)
 - More Scalable than System 3
 - Compatibility with Commercially Available [Wireless Hardware Throttles](throttles.html) and [Wireless Throttle Apps](throttles.html)
 - [Web-based Layout Control Software](web_control.html)
